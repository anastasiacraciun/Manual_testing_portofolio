# Final project for ITF Manual Testing Course

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application. 

Application under test: https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com

API Documentation: https://orangehrm.github.io/orangehrm-api-doc/

**The final project will be split into 2 sections: [Testing section](https://github.com/anastasiacraciun/Manual_testing_portofolio/blob/main/Final%20Project/README.md#1-testing-section) and [SQL section](https://github.com/anastasiacraciun/Manual_testing_portofolio/blob/main/Final%20Project/README.md#2-sql-section).**

Tools used:Jira, Zephyr Squad, Postman, MySQL Workbench.

# 1 Testing section

## 1.1 Test Planning

The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the 'Work Experience' module from the OrangeHRM application. 

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan

#### 1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated
* Project manager - Tudor Amariei
* Product owner - Maria Barcari
* Software developer - Diana Raducu
* QA Engineer - Craciun Anastasia

#### 1.1.2 Entry criteria defined
* functional specifications are defined
* roles needed for the project are allocated
* initial project risks were detected and mitigated

#### 1.1.3 Exit criteria defined
* number of unresolved bugs is insignificant or they have low priority
* all tests have been executed
* all resolved bugs have been re-tested and approved by the QA team
* deadline was reached
* no detected major risk remained un-mitigated
* exploratory regression testing must be performed on the My Info module, which includes the Work Eperience section

#### 1.1.4 Test scope

* __Tests in scope:__ All the feature of Work Experience section which were defined in software requirement specs need to be tested: functional testing, GUI testing and API testing
* __Tests not in scope:__  performance testing, integrations of the dependents module with other modules, compatibility testing with multiple browsers

#### 1.1.5 Risks detected

* Project risks:  lack of experience of the QA team, short deadline of Zephyr Squad trial, unavailability of test environment
* Product risks: validation constraints on the fields might be too restrictive to the end-user

#### 1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria

The entry criterias defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue. 

## 1.2 Test Monitoring and Control

Various periodic reports were generated to reflect the current status of the testing process, in case of major problems control measures could be taken. The following status report was generated after 73% of the test cases were executed, on 20th of June 2022:

## 1.4 Test Design

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases 
are:
